## About The Project

This project is a simulation of tram movements using the Qt framework. The user can input a JSON object that contains information about the stops and trams in the simulation.

## Getting Started

The user must provide a JSON object that includes the following information:

Distance between each stop: An array of numbers representing the distance between each stop in the simulation.
Array of stops: An array of objects, each representing a stop. Each stop has a name and a time to spend on it.
Array of trams: An array of objects, each representing a tram. Each tram has a safe distance property.

### Prerequisites

Qt framework
A compiler that supports C++11 or higher.

## Usage

To run the simulation, simply run the code and input the required JSON object. The simulation will display the movements of the trams in real-time.
