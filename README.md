## About The Project

This project is a simulation of tram movements using the Qt framework. The user can input a JSON object that contains information about the stops and trams in the simulation.

## Input

The user must provide a JSON object that includes the following information:

1.Distance between each stop: An array of numbers representing the distance between each stop in the simulation.<br>
2.Array of stops: An array of objects, each representing a stop. Each stop has a name and a time to spend on it.<br>
3.Array of trams: An array of objects, each representing a tram. Each tram has a safe distance property.

## Requirements

Qt framework <br>
A compiler that supports C++11 or higher.

## Usage

To run the simulation, simply run the code and input the required JSON object. The simulation will display the movements of the trams in real-time.

## Functionality

The simulator will simulate the movements of the trams between stops, taking into account the distance between stops and the time each tram spends at each stop. The trams will maintain a safe distance from each other at all times.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple and intuitive simulation of tram movements, using the Qt framework and a user-defined JSON object as input. It is a useful tool for understanding the dynamics of tram systems and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as planning and optimizing tram routes.
